# iMPReSSioN - a Python/Flask app for in-depth movie and show reviews

This is my first full-stack individual project. It's a Python app, using the Flask framework, that utilizes an IMDb API to provide movie and show data and pictures. The user can see a list of popular shows and movies or search for a particular title. A user can select any title for information and leave a unique style review if they are logged in. The goal of this app is to create a more user-centered review experience. I think I accomplished this to a degree, but I would like to add quite a few more features to allow for a more immersive experience and finish out the UI.
